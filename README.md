This is an application I made on Python that takes birthday information from the user, and counts down until their next birthday. The user also has the option to go back and change their input, if they have typed something wrong. It is a simple project, however I learned quite a bit and it was a nice opportunity for me to practice conditional statements. I also tried to document the program well by putting comments to make things clear for someone who opens up the code for the first time.

The toughest part was no doubt the calculation of leap years. When a ValueError was raised, Python would raise an error even if the leap year existed. So to by-pass that, I learned that there was a function called suppress.

Learnings: Learned about the suppress function, practiced my conditional and loop statements. I had to come up with unique solutions for leap years, and it was nice training for me.
Also tried documenting the program very clearly, using comments as I saw necessary.

I programmed this application without following any tutorials. I only read documentation and skimmed the web for possible solutions to specific problems I encountered.
